## AIM
    To obtain the DC analysis ,AC analysis ,Transient analysis of a Common Source(CS)amplifier and also obtain gain and other parameters using LT spice.
## INTRODUCTION 
    A Common Source amplifier is a basic MOSFET-based circuit used circuit to amplify signals. In this circuit the input is applied to the gate , the source is connected to ground and the output is taken from the drain.
    1. DC ANALYSIS: Finds the operating point of the MOSFET by checking voltage and currents.
    2. AC ANALYSIS: Measures the gain and frequency response to see how well the amplifier works at different frequencies.
    3. TRANSIENT ANALYSIS: Observes how the amplifier responds to a time-varying signal.
